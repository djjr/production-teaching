  { 
    question: "What is the difference between functional rationality and substantive rationality?", 
    answer: "Functional rationality is about efficiently achieving a goal, while substantive rationality considers whether the goal itself is reasonable or desirable.", 
    tags: ["collins"] },
  { 
    question: "What is 'precontractual solidarity,' and why does Collins say it's necessary for society?", 
    answer: "Precontractual solidarity is the nonrational trust that must exist before contracts can function. Without it, rational individuals would never agree to contracts due to fear of cheating.", 
    tags: ["collins", "solidarity"] },
  { 
    question: "Why does Collins think rational individuals can't create contracts on their own?", 
    answer: "Because rational agents will always calculate the risk of being cheated and thus prefer to cheat first or not engage—creating a deadlock.", 
    tags: ["collins"] },
  { 
    question: "What is the 'free rider problem'? Give a real-world example.", 
    answer: "It's when individuals benefit from a collective good without contributing to it. Example: using public transit for free while others pay voluntarily.", 
    tags: ["collins"] },
  { 
    question: "What happened in the Kitty Genovese case, and how does Collins use it?", 
    answer: "Genovese was murdered while dozens of bystanders failed to call police. Collins uses it to illustrate how individuals rationally assume others will act—so no one does.", 
    tags: ["collins"] },
  { 
    question: "Why does Collins say that even the state depends on nonrational solidarity?", 
    answer: "Because the state's power depends on shared beliefs in its legitimacy. Without these shared sentiments, even state officials wouldn't cooperate.", 
    tags: ["collins"] },
  { 
    question: "How does Collins critique the idea that enforcement alone (courts, police) explains cooperation?", 
    answer: "He argues that these systems themselves require internal solidarity to function. Enforcement can't work unless officials trust and cooperate.", 
    tags: ["collins", "solidarity"] },
  { 
    question: "What role do rituals play in group solidarity, according to Durkheim (and Collins)?", 
    answer: "Rituals generate emotional bonds and shared identity, creating the trust and unity needed for cooperation.", 
    tags: ["collins"] },
  { 
    question: "What is symbolic about money, according to Collins?", 
    answer: "Money carries meaning beyond its economic value. A small fee can symbolically shift a situation from 'public good' to 'private responsibility,' changing how people behave. It signals obligation and mutual awareness, not just cost.", 
    tags: ["collins"] },
  { 
    question: "Why does Collins argue that both solidarity and conflict depend on nonrational feelings?", 
    answer: "Because even conflict requires internal group cohesion. Groups need shared emotional commitment to mobilize against others.", 
    tags: ["collins", "solidarity"] }
