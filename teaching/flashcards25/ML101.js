    question: "What is a model?", 
    answer: "A model is a function that maps inputs to outputs, a prediction machine.", 
    tags: ["ML101a"] 
},
{
    question: "What is a loss function?", 
    answer: "A loss function is a measure of how wrong a model's predictions are.", 
    tags: ["ML101a"] 
},
{
    question: "In machine learning, what does optimizer refer to?", 
    answer: "The optimizer changes the model to improves its predictions. It optimizes (minimizes) the loss function by making changes that improve the model's output.", 
    tags: ["ML101a"] 
},
{
    question: "What do we mean by training?", 
    answer: "Training is the process of making the model better at predicting. The model looks at data and makes a prediction. The loss function says how bad the prediction is. The optimizer tweaks the model in the direction of better predictions.", 
    tags: ["ML101a"] 
},
{
    question: "Distinguish supervised from unsupervised learning.", 
    answer: "Supervised learning uses labeled data - we teach by showing the model the answers. In unsupervised learning, the model learns by finding patterns in the data.",
