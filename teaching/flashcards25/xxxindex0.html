      { question: "What should you do?", answer: "Specify a tag in the URL!", tags: ["generic"] },
      { question: "What is the difference between functional rationality and substantive rationality?", answer: "Functional rationality is about efficiently achieving a goal, while substantive rationality considers whether the goal itself is reasonable or desirable.", tags: ["collins"] },
      { question: "What is 'precontractual solidarity,' and why does Collins say itâ€™s necessary for society?", answer: "Precontractual solidarity is the nonrational trust that must exist before contracts can function. Without it, rational individuals would never agree to contracts due to fear of cheating.", tags: ["collins"] },
      { question: "Why does Collins think rational individuals canâ€™t create contracts on their own?", answer: "Because rational agents will always calculate the risk of being cheated and thus prefer to cheat first or not engageâ€”creating a deadlock.", tags: ["collins"] },
      { question: "What is the 'free rider problem'? Give a real-world example.", answer: "Itâ€™s when individuals benefit from a collective good without contributing to it. Example: using public transit for free while others pay voluntarily.", tags: ["collins"] },
      { question: "What happened in the Kitty Genovese case, and how does Collins use it?", answer: "Genovese was murdered while dozens of bystanders failed to call police. Collins uses it to illustrate how individuals rationally assume others will actâ€”so no one does.", tags: ["collins"] },
      { question: "Why does Collins say that even the state depends on nonrational solidarity?", answer: "Because the state's power depends on shared beliefs in its legitimacy. Without these shared sentiments, even state officials wouldnâ€™t cooperate.", tags: ["collins"] },
      { question: "How does Collins critique the idea that enforcement alone (courts, police) explains cooperation?", answer: "He argues that these systems themselves require internal solidarity to function. Enforcement can't work unless officials trust and cooperate.", tags: ["collins"] },
      { question: "What role do rituals play in group solidarity, according to Durkheim (and Collins)?", answer: "Rituals generate emotional bonds and shared identity, creating the trust and unity needed for cooperation.", tags: ["collins"] },
      { question: "What is symbolic about money, according to Collins?", answer: "Money carries meaning beyond its economic value. A small fee can symbolically shift a situation from 'public good' to 'private responsibility,' changing how people behave. It signals obligation and mutual awareness, not just cost.", tags: ["collins"] },
      { question: "Why does Collins argue that both solidarity and conflict depend on nonrational feelings?", answer: "Because even conflict requires internal group cohesion. Groups need shared emotional commitment to mobilize against others.", tags: ["collins"] }
