  {
    "question": "What is the difference between functional rationality and substantive rationality?",
    "answer": "Functional rationality is about efficiently achieving a goal, while substantive rationality considers whether the goal itself is reasonable or desirable."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is 'precontractual solidarity,' and why does Collins say it’s necessary for society?",
    "answer": "Precontractual solidarity is the nonrational trust that must exist before contracts can function. Without it, rational individuals would never agree to contracts due to fear of cheating."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does Collins think rational individuals can’t create contracts on their own?",
    "answer": "Because rational agents will always calculate the risk of being cheated and thus prefer to cheat first or not engage—creating a deadlock."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the 'free rider problem'? Give a real-world example.",
    "answer": "It’s when individuals benefit from a collective good without contributing to it. Example: using public transit for free while others pay voluntarily."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happened in the Kitty Genovese case, and how does Collins use it?",
    "answer": "Genovese was murdered while dozens of bystanders failed to call police. Collins uses it to illustrate how individuals rationally assume others will act—so no one does."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does Collins say that even the state depends on nonrational solidarity?",
    "answer": "Because the state's power depends on shared beliefs in its legitimacy. Without these shared sentiments, even state officials wouldn’t cooperate."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Collins critique the idea that enforcement alone (courts, police) explains cooperation?",
    "answer": "He argues that these systems themselves require internal solidarity to function. Enforcement can't work unless officials trust and cooperate."
  },
  {
    "question": "What role do rituals play in group solidarity, according to Durkheim (and Collins)?",
    "answer": "Rituals generate emotional bonds and shared identity, creating the trust and unity needed for cooperation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is symbolic about money, according to Collins?",
    "answer": "Small fees, though trivial in cost, shift people's mindset from 'free rider' to responsible user—showing money's symbolic power in social systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does Collins argue that both solidarity and conflict depend on nonrational feelings?",
    "answer": "Because even conflict requires internal group cohesion. Groups need shared emotional commitment to mobilize against others."
