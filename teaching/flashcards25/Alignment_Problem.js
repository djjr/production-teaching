  {
    question: "Alignment Problem",
    answer: "The challenge of ensuring AI systems do what humans intendâ€”not just what we explicitly tell them. E.g., boat goes for points not proper racing.",
    tags: ["Christian, The Alignment Problem"]
  },
  {
    question: "Rewarding A while hoping for B",
    answer: "A classic misalignment failure: systems optimize for measurable proxies that don't match human intentions.",
    tags: ["Christian, The Alignment Problem"]
  },
  {
    question: "Machine Learning (ML)",
    answer: "A method where computers learn patterns from data, instead of being explicitly programmed.",
    tags: ["Christian, The Alignment Problem"]
  },
  {
    question: "Unsupervised Learning",
    answer: "A type of ML where the system finds patterns in data without labeled outcomes. E.g., learning word associations from text corpora.",
    tags: ["Christian, The Alignment Problem"]
  },
  {
    question: "Supervised Learning",
    answer: "ML that uses labeled data (input-output pairs) to learn a predictive function. E.g., learning behavior prediction from historical records.",
    tags: ["Christian, The Alignment Problem"]
  },
  {
    question: "Reinforcement Learning (RL)",
    answer: "ML where an agent learns by trial and error in an environment with rewards and penalties.",
    tags: ["Christian, The Alignment Problem"]

  {
    question: "Word Embeddings",
    answer: "Numerical representations of words capturing their meanings based on context. E.g., king - man + woman = queen",

  {
    question: "Bias in AI",
    answer: "Systematic errors or unfair outcomes resulting from data, models, or assumptions. E.g., resume bot prefers male-coded words.",
    tags: ["Christian, The Alignment Problem"]
  },
  {
    question: "Proxy Variable",
    answer: "A stand-in metric used when the true goal is hard to measure. E.g., points instead of playing game well.",

  },
  {
    question: "Objective Function",
    answer: "The formal specification of what an AI should optimize. E.g., the score in a game.",

    question: "Black Box Model",
    answer: "A system whose internal workings are opaque or difficult to interpret. We just know the inputs and the outputs.",
